							<h3 style="margin-top: 10px;">Medieval City Otrar</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 20px;">After the ambassadors of Genghis Khan were executed here, in 1219 the city was besieged by Mongol troops led by the sons of Genghis Khan. The siege lasted 6 months. Hunger and dissatisfaction with the refusal to negotiate with the Mongols began in the city, one night one of the residents of the city opened the gates to the Mongols. The Mongols who seized the city after that destroyed a significant part of the population, the rest were taken into slavery, the city itself was burned and destroyed. A traitor named Karadzha, who opened the city gates, was personally executed by Jochi. Cairo Khan, who fought to the last, was not just executed by Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan was struck by the courage and bravery of the warrior and considered that simply executing him was an unworthy death. Genghis Khan filled Cairo Khan's eyes and mouth with silver.</p>

							<h3>Arystanbab mausoleum</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 20px;">According to legend, Arystanbab died and was buried in the vicinity of Otrar in the XII century. Probably, at the same time his mausoleum was built, about which there is no reliable information.
							It is not known for certain what became of the mausoleum after the Otrar catastrophe, when the troops of Jochi, after a seven-month siege, completely destroyed the nearby large city of Otrar, along with its entire population.
							In the XIV century, by order of Timur, a new structure was erected on the site of Daniyar Khan of the collapsing building. But it has not survived to this day. In the 18th century, on the site of an ancient mazar destroyed by an earthquake, a two-domed structure with an aivan resting on two carved wooden columns was built.</p>

							<h3>Arystanbab Mosque</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 20px;">As the legend says, by order of Tamerlane, the construction of a mosque began over the grave of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi (1338-1405). All attempts to erect the walls failed, a strong storm demolished them, according to another version, the appearance of a green bull that destroyed everything. The saint who appeared in a dream to Timur said that first it was necessary to build a mausoleum over the grave of Saint Arystan Bab, and then over the grave of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi, which Timur did. Therefore, the pilgrims are the first to visit the mausoleum of the teacher Arystan-Bab, and then the mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi</p>
